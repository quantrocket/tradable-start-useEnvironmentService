tradable-start-useEnvironmentService
=========================

This is a simple app that uses the *com.tradable.api.services.environment.EnvironmentService* API. You can use this template if you want to start a project that would use information contained in that Service. Or if you want to see how it works.
See the REAMDE included in the tradable project to see how to open the project in Eclipse.
